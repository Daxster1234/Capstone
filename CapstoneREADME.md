## Definition Statement
### I want to build a website that my band can use for promotion, tickets and selling merchandise.
---
## Definition of Audience
### People who are interested in or fans of the band, locally or otherwise.
---

## Pages should be homepage, about us, contact, merch, tickets/events
### Homepage - Logo, quick introduction, maybe a video, links to other parts of the page
### About us - who we are, what we do, why you should be interested
### Contact - contact for the band and a form to send an email to me for whatever reason
### Merch - page to show merchandise and sell items
### Tickets/Events - calendar showing when and where we're playing, updated live

---
## Design Elements
### Dark colors, black and white, red
### Band logo
### Fonts? Will have to look around more, something readable but "edgy" fitting with the theme

# SWOT Analysis
## Strengths
1. Provides a platform specifically catered to the band
2. Centralizes all information about the band to one place
## Weaknesses
1. Usefulness is dependant on who is interested in the band
2. Isn't backed by a large company like ticketmaster
## Opportunities
1. To grow the band as a whole
2. Provide a platform for information, potentially drawing in new fans
## Threats
1. Other, more popular bands websites will get more attention
2. Some sites are backed by large companies with much more functionality
